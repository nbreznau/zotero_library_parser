Second, there is a negative correlation between firms' innovation activity and their export share to low-income destinations. This note uses recently available comparable high quality firm level data for six European countries (including Italy) and similarly specified empirical models in an attempt to replicate these results. Replication failed completely.

The AER Data Availability Policy requires that the authors provide data and programs that permits replication, but only need to give access to raw data on request. The authors have been contacted per mail but have not replied so far.3 The results of all regressions shown in the paper can be replicated by using the data and code that the authors provide.4 The code for several graphs is not provided in the do-ﬁle.5 We ﬁnd that it is difﬁcult to replicate the variables in the dta-ﬁle given that the raw data is not included and the description of the variables not sufﬁciently precise.6 The authors refer to several Davidson-MacKinnon tests7, to show that their suggested ﬁnancial stability model outperforms the traditional one.8 We can not ﬁnd the corresponding STATA code in the do-ﬁle. 1See Obstfeld et al. p. 54-94. 2http://ineteconomics.org/grants/replication-economics 3http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data.php/ (01.09.2013) 4All tests in this paper refer to the pooled OLS regressions in table 1, page 73. 5See Obstfeld et al.
