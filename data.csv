The CR study investigated the efficiency gains in a returns to schooling example by applying alternative sets of instrumental variables estimators for panel data regressions proposed by Hausman and Taylor (1981), Amemiya and MaCurdy (1986), and Breusch, Mizon, and Schmidt (1989). Corrections on the CR data set lead to changes in the legitimate set of instruments, when the time dummies are excluded from the regression, and to much lower empirical gains in efficiency than those reported in CR. If the time dummies are retained in the wage equation, the experience coefficient is not estimable by the within regression, and the empirical gains in efficiency from using the IV procedures are not limited to the time-invariant education coefficient.",401-406,,5,4,Articles in Wiki,,,

Tootell, ",Lynn Elaine Browne; Geoffrey M.B. Tootell,1995,,,,New England Economic Review,New England Economic Review,,,"Three years ago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an examination of racial patterns in mortgage denial rates in the Boston area. The study was motivated by newly available data on mortgage applications, showing that black and Hispanic applicants were two to three times as likely to be turned down for mortgages as white applicants. The study gathered all the variables thought to be missing from the HMDA analysis, such as the applicants' debt burdens and credit histories, to see whether these economic factors explained the racial difference in denial rates. Although the additional information did explain much of the difference, after taking account of economic factors the applicant's race still significantly affected the probability of getting a mortgage.

The study has been influential and has caused many institutions to review their lending practices and supervisory agencies to alter their examination procedures. The study has also drawn criticism, with critics claiming that variables have been omitted, the model misspecified, errors made in the data, and information about racial differences in foreclosures ignored. This article provides a detailed rebuttal to these criticisms and shows that even after incorporating the concerns of some of the study's strongest critics, applicants' race as well as economic characteristics affected the probability of getting a mortgage in 1990.",53-78,en,,September/October,Z6BGTXE4,,,

The widespread use of MTurk subjects, a practice that dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for experimental research, has been controversial. At the same time, law and psychology’s home discipline is experiencing a public crisis of confidence widely discussed in terms of the “replication crisis.” At present, law and psychology research is arguably in a new era, in which it is both an accepted feature of the legal landscape and also a target of fresh skepticism.

These estimators can be interpreted as instrumental variables procedures using an instrument that is independent of disturbances even in finite samples. Independence is achieved by using a 'leave-one-out' jackknife-type fitted value in place of the usual first stage equation. The new estimators are first order equivalent to 2SLS but with finite-sample properties superior, in terms of bias and coverage rate of confidence intervals, compared to those of 2SLS and similar to those of LIML, when there are many instruments.",57-67,,14,1,Articles in Wiki,,,

Por el contrario, la IED en Ecuador se ha comportado de manera irregular y con una evolución por momentos negativa. Existen diferentes hipótesis para explicar estos resultados, uno de ellos el que tiene que ver con la alta carga tributaria que enfrentan los agentes.

We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.",115-170,en,88,1,Articles in Wiki,,,
